# Welcome to The Brain Game, Season 1

You will be given 2 problems of medium and hard difficulty. 
**First 3 people to send in correct solutions will be featured in Hall of Fame on this site and will get a surprise voucher**

Each problem is described in 2 parts. First part is the puzzle part which you can solve using general knowledge.
For the second part, you might need to write the code in the programming language of your choice.  

If you do not know coding, no issues. You can just mail me the first part of solution and you will be eligible for vouchers.

So let the games begin !!!! 

<br /> <br /> 

## Find the counterfeit 
We are given 4 coins of which 1 is fake. <br>
But the scamsters are smart and it is not known if the coin is heavier or lighter. You have a 2 pan balance like the one shown below can you find the fake coin?
How many times do you have to use the pan balance to figure it out

### Bonus Part
Can you solve the same for 13 coins 

### Bonus Part 2
What if I ask you to solve for N coins. Can you write a code for this?


<br /> <br /> 

## Scale the Bell Tower
This is a famous puzzle. 

We have two eggs and we wish to know which floor of 100-floor high Bell Tower it is safe to throw the egg.
We need to divise a strategy such that total number of drops in worst case is minimum. 

So obviously, if you thought of naive strategy from starting from 0 floor and moving upwards.
This will end up having 99 drops if the eggs break from 100th floor.  

So now can you give a better strategy for this problem?

We may make a few assumptions:
- An egg that survives a fall can be used again.
- A broken egg must be discarded.
- The effect of a fall is the same for all eggs.
- If an egg breaks when dropped, then it would break if dropped from a higher floor.
- If an egg survives a fall then it would survive a shorter fall.

### Bonus Part
If you can give the equation you have used to solve this problem. You get bonus points  

## How to send solutions
You need to give the answer and explain your approach to the problems in detail. You can use any tool you deem fit for this purpose <br>
<br>
The Sending part, you can do it in multiple ways, whichever convenient <br>
